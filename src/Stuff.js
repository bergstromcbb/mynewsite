        <p>I am a creative mother of one amazing 16 year old high school Junior. 
          <p>Here is my elevator speech: </p>
          Four years ago I was talked into a clojure bridge workshop in Detroit.  That day changed my future.
          I went home and plotted about how I was going to make the career change I now knew I made.  See 
          I started my career in web development and then took the path of least resistance.  In 2016 I went to 
          Grand Circus and completed their Front End Bootcamp.  A month later I started my first postion as a 
          developer and have yet to look back.  I have had the opportunity to try so many things especially in 
          late 2018 having taken some great contract positions.  I am looking forward to great things in 2019 and 
          excited for the amazing opportunities the year holds.
          <p>
            Some of the fun things coming are:
